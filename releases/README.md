# EEG Toolkit releases

This folder will contain the releases of the EEG toolkit library, and a changelog of what has been altered with each version. The libraries contained here are all release builds, if a debug build of the current code is required, let me know and I can provide one (or check out the code and build it).

### eegtoolkit-0.0.1.aar

Initial release! Containing views:
  - GraphGLView and GraphSurfaceView for streaming time series.
  - ConnectionStrengthView for showing live sensor connections.
  - EpochSurfaceView for showing multiple time series epochs simultaneously.
  - Plot2DView (experimental) for rendering a history of concurrent time series as 2D points.

plus a bunch of code supporting data collection and analysis in pure java code without visualization.
